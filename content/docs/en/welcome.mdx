# Welcome

Welcome to AI Coding Stack documentation. AI Coding Stack is a comprehensive directory and metadata repository for the AI coding ecosystem.

## What is AI Coding Stack?

AI Coding Stack serves two main purposes:

1. **A public website** at [aicodingstack.io](https://aicodingstack.io) for discovering and comparing AI coding tools
2. **A community-maintained metadata repository** containing curated information about coding tools, models, and platforms

## Key Features

- **IDEs** - Integrated development environments with AI integration
- **CLIs** - Command-line AI coding assistants
- **Models** - Large language models optimized for coding tasks
- **Providers** - LLM API providers and platforms

### Community-Driven
All metadata is maintained in JSON manifest files, making it easy for the community to contribute, update, and improve the information about various tools.

### Easy Discovery

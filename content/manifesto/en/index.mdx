## What is AI Coding Stack?

The AI Coding Stack represents a fundamental shift in how we build software. It defines a new paradigm where artificial intelligence is deeply integrated into every aspect of the development workflow, creating a cohesive ecosystem that amplifies developer productivity.

At its core, the AI Coding Stack is a unified ecosystem of essential components that work together to create a seamless, intelligent development experience. **IDEs**, **CLIs**, **Extensions**, and **Models** form the foundation of modern AI-assisted programming, each serving a distinct purpose while working in harmony.

**IDEs** like Cursor and VS Code provide the visual interface where code comes to life, offering intelligent autocomplete, code generation, and contextual assistance. **Extensions** supercharge these editors with AI-powered capabilities—from advanced code completion and intelligent refactoring to specialized language support and productivity tools. **CLIs** such as Claude Code bring AI capabilities directly to your command line, enabling natural language interactions with your codebase.

**Models** including DeepSeek, Kimi, Claude, and GPT power the intelligence behind every suggestion, code generation, and analysis, providing the connective tissue that makes your entire stack truly intelligent.

The power of the AI Coding Stack lies not in any single tool, but in how these components integrate. When your IDE understands your codebase context, when your CLI leverages the same models as your editor, and when your terminal intelligently suggests commands based on your workflow—that's when true productivity emerges.

The future of coding is not just AI-assisted—it's AI-orchestrated. Welcome to the AI Coding Stack.
